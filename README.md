# Introduce
This is just a simple project.Export all pictures, videos, audios to a single html file. That may useless.
# Why would I do that
Well, recently(2020.11), Google announced a notification, that Google Photos is no longer serve you infinite storage space, even at compressed size. So I used Google Takeout, I downloaded all pictures and videos, and I want to store them on OneDrive. And I want to make a webpage, like a collection(sort of). But I have... Literally, tens of thousands of pictures, it's not possible to do it manually. And I'm a programmer, I love to write some simple programs to make my life easier, so, this project borned.
# Wishes
Hope you enjoy that!
