# Introduce
This is just a simple project.Export all pictures, videos, audios to a single html file. That may useless.
# Why would I do that
Well, recently(2020.11), Google announced a notification, that Google Photos is no longer serve you infinite storage space, even at compressed size. So I used Google Takeout, I downloaded all pictures and videos, and I want to store them on OneDrive. And I want to make a webpage, like a collection(sort of). But I have... Literally, tens of thousands of pictures, it's not possible to do it manually. And I'm a programmer, I love to write some simple programs to make my life easier, so, this project borned.
# Usage
First of all, I need to say, this program is MICROSOFT WINDOWS ONLY!!!
Because as far as I can tell, there is no API(s) can list the folder. So we have to use Windows's 'dir /b' command.
If you know the API(s) that can list the folder. I'm glad to get your Pull Request!
# Wishes
Hope you enjoy that!
